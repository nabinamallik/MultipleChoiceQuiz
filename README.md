## Multiple-Choice Quiz

#Overview:
The Multiple-Choice Quiz project is a Java-based application that allows users to take part in an interactive quiz consisting of multiple-choice questions. The program presents a series of questions to the user, along with options for each question. The user can select an option as their answer, and the program provides immediate feedback on whether the chosen answer is correct or incorrect. At the end of the quiz, the user's score is displayed, showcasing how many questions they answered correctly out of the total.
